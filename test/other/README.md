# Types test

This folder contains several classes used to test the concepts that restrict the
types that can be specified as data structure holding the data to cluster, or
the values of `pi`, or the values of `lambda`.

Since the compiler takes several minutes to compile these classes, this project
is not included in the main `CMakeLists.txt` file.
