# Final Project HPC

Final project of High Performance Computing developed by Alessio De Biasi (870288) and Jonathan
Gobbo (870506).

This project is organized in several directories, namely:

- The `project` directory, which contains the implementations of the clustering algorithms;
- The `test` directory, which contains several test applications;
- The `visualizer` directory, which contains a collection of applications that deal with
  hierarchical clusters of points.

Refer to the `README.md` files in those directories for further information.
